To start the Value iteration process, simply clone the repository and run main.py.

You will first see the iteration number, the changes in the values and the changes in the policies. This will continue untill the delte is reached. 

Then you will get a message in the command line. When you type 'Ja' the program will simulate an agent on starting position [1, 0] walking the best path 
(according to our Value iteration proces) and will show you the path it has taken.
